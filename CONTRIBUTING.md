## Writing guidelines

- **Use active voice**: "Run the command" not "The command should be run"
- **Address the reader directly**: Use "you" instead of "the user"
- **Keep sentences concise**: Aim for one idea per sentence
- **Lead with the goal**: Start instructions with what the user wants to accomplish
- **Use consistent terminology**: Don't alternate between synonyms for the same concept
- **Include examples**: Show, don't just tell

## Updating Screenshots

When the web UI changes, regenerate screenshots using the automated pipeline:

```bash
./scripts/run-screenshots.sh

```

The script will:
1. Build IronClaw if the binary is not found
2. Start IronClaw with a temporary database
3. Seed test data via REST API
4. Run Playwright tests to capture verified UI screenshots
5. Generate Mintlify documentation from test metadata
6. Clean up and stop IronClaw

### Configuration

Copy `.env.screenshot.template` to `.env.screenshot` at the repo root to customize:

```bash
cp .env.screenshot.template .env.screenshot
```

Available options:
- `SCREENSHOT_VIEWPORT`: Viewport dimensions (default: 1280x800)
- `SCREENSHOT_PORT`: Port for temporary IronClaw instance (default: 13001)
- `HEALTH_TIMEOUT`: Seconds to wait for IronClaw to start (default: 60)
- `IRONCLAW_TOKEN`: Auth token for screenshot server (default: screenshot-test-token)

See `.env.screenshot.template` for all options.

### Reviewing Generated Documentation

After running the capture script:

1. Review screenshots in `docs/assets/screenshots/`
2. Review generated docs in `docs/ui-reference/`
3. Edit generated `.mdx` files to add edge cases or clarify instructions
4. Commit both screenshots and documentation together:

```bash
git add docs/assets/screenshots/ docs/ui-reference/
git commit -m "docs: update UI screenshots and reference docs"
```

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Port already in use | Change `SCREENSHOT_PORT` in `.env.screenshot` |
| IronClaw build fails | Run `cargo build --release` manually and check errors |
| Playwright browser missing | Run `npx playwright install chromium` |
| Tests timeout | Increase `HEALTH_TIMEOUT` in `.env.screenshot` |
| Tests fail | Check IronClaw is running and accessible at the configured URL |
| Screenshots look wrong | Adjust `SCREENSHOT_VIEWPORT` for different dimensions |
